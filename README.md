# tagged-neutron-DIS
Event generator for leading neutron tagged DIS process, which is useful for constraining pion structure function

# 1. Event generation of e p --> e' n X data

Using ROOT to execute the codes:

>root -l -q test.cpp



# 2. Get the pionic parton distributions from IMParton

<testPiPDF.cpp> is the sample code for the users.
Using ROOT to execute the codes:                                                                                                                                      
>root -l testPiPDF.cpp
